# node-react-with-travis-heroku
Example template for node-react app that can be built in Travis CI and deployed to Heroku. In local development app is running in docker containers. 

If you don't want to use docker, you can set dev environment to your local machine normally with `npm install`. In this case you need PostgreSQL installed (and database created). Also, you need to add `.env` file to backend and add same variables that are defined in docker-compose.yml in backend -> environment.

## Prequisites
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* ([psql](https://www.postgresql.org/) if you don't want to run app in docker)
* [travis CLI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb)
* [heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

## Set up development environment
- Copy template to your local machine. You can, for example, download or clone and set new remote.

### Run
- Ensure that docker is running, and then in project root dir run:  
```docker-compose up```  

To run containers in detached mode, use `docker-compose up -d`  
If you want to run only some of the containers, specify containers, for example `docker-compose up backend db`
- `docker ps -a` to check which containers are running and in which ports
- backend is served in `localhost:9000` (example api in `localhost:9000/api/v1/hello/world`)
- frontend is served in `localhost:8000`
- db is served localhost:5432

### Stop containers
```docker-compose down```

### Remove images
```docker system prune -a```

### Remove volumes
- list volumes `docker volume ls`
- remove specific volume `docker volume rm [VOLUME NAME]`

### Building images
If you need to build images, you can use (or with --no-cache flag)  

```docker-compose build```

### Access to a docker container
To access eg. backend container, run  
```docker-compose exec backend sh```  
This links the container's bash to your local shell.


## ESLint
Both backend and frontend have configuration for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESLint has integrations for several editors (https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations), and it's recommended to use such extension, as it makes it easy to detect possible errors. To get it work in your editor, you have to install eslint packages to you local machine (`npm install`, see packages from package.jsons). 

Both backend and frontend use [airbnb-config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (defined in .eslintrc file). It's also possible to use some other configuration, or add rules directly to `.eslintrc` file.

### Run lint in command line
It's highly recommended to use ESLint in editor, but if you want to run lint in command line, run (in backend or frontend):
```npm run lint```

## Building in Travis
When project exists in github, you can activate it in Travis CI   
* https://travis-ci.org/ => sign in with github
* Add new repository by activating repository from repository list  

- Create a git branch from where you want travis to build automatically (in this example it is Â´development`). If you're using some other named branch than development, change branch name in .travis.yml -> branches -> only: [your_branch_name]
- Push your changes to "build branch", and travis will start the build process. 
### Build process
- Travis builds project according to `.travis.yml` file. There is specified which nodejs version should be used, what other services does it need (docker) and which branch it builds.
- `script` -phase defines what should be done in travis. In this example project, it runs ESLint for backend, builds project with docker-compose and prepares frontend bundle for heroku deployment. If eslint detects errors (or any other phase fails), build fails and app will not be deployed.

## Deploying to Heroku
